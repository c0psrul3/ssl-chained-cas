<h1>CA Chain setup notes</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document describes the steps we took to set up a multi-level
<a href="http://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a>-based Certificate Authority
for use with <a href="http://www.globus.org/">Globus'</a>
<a href="http://www.globus.org/security/">GSI</a>.<p>

<p>Our goal was to establish a multi-level CA.  The difference between
a multi-level CA and a single-level CA is that in a single-level CA,
the root key is also the signing key for host and user certificates.
We wanted to establish a root key which we could use to sign (and
revoke if necessary) several signing keys which will be used for
different purposes.  So, if a local PKI is represented a tree where
nodes are keys and edges are certificates, a single-level tree is
height two and has just one non-leaf node, while our tree is height
three and has a single root node, and several second level nodes.

<p>For more information on setting up a single-level CA, see the <a
href="http://www.modssl.org/docs/2.8/ssl_faq.html">mod_ssl FAQ</a>.
Setting up a CA for GSI is very similar to setting up a CA for
Apache's <code>mod_ssl</code>.  However, in the multi-level case,
there are some differences.  Specifically, Apache
w/<code>mod_ssl</code> doesn't care if the signing keys do not have
the "CA:TRUE" bit set, while GSI does.

<h2>Customize the configuration file for easy data entry</h2>

<p>While this step isn't strictly necessary for the following process,
doing it makes subsequent steps a bit easier, and increases the
chances of getting things right, and consistent.

Make a copy of the <a href="http://cvs.openssl.org/getfile?f=openssl/apps/openssl.cnf"><code>openssl.cnf</code></a> 
file, and change the defaults to suit your installation.  Scroll
to the section labeled <code>[&nbsp;req_distinguished_name&nbsp;]</code> and
change the lines with the suffix <code>_default</code>.

For example, our altered section reads as follows:
<pre>[ req_distinguished_name ]              
countryName                     = Country Name (2 letter code)
countryName_default             = US
countryName_min                 = 2
countryName_max                 = 2

stateOrProvinceName             = State or Province Name (full name)
stateOrProvinceName_default     = Wisconsin

localityName                    = Locality Name (eg, city)
localityName_default            = Madison

0.organizationName              = Organization Name (eg, company)
0.organizationName_default      = University of Wisconsin -- Madison

1.organizationName              = Second Organization Name (eg, company)
1.organizationName_default      = Computer Sciences Department

organizationalUnitName          = Organizational Unit Name (eg, section)
organizationalUnitName_default  = Condor Project

commonName                      = Common Name (eg, YOUR name)
commonName_max                  = 64

emailAddress                    = Email Address
emailAddress_max                = 40
</pre>

<h2>Policy</h2>
<p>For now we ignore the certificate revocation issues.
</p><p>
The key size must be determined: we used 1024 bits.
</p><p>
Two periods must be determined: the validity period of the root
certificate, and the validity period of the signing certificate.  For
the first pass at the CA, we used twenty years (7300 days) for the
former, and three years (1095 days) for the latter.  Ten years (3650 days) 
may be more reasonable for the root key.
</p><p>
The security of the root key is critical, because it is so long lived,
and because it can be used to revoke the signing key if necessary.
So, we established the policy that the root key is never stored or
decrypted on a machine which has an active network connection.  I turn
off my laptop's wireless connection, create the key, create a cd with
just the key on it, burn the cd, and remove the key from the laptop.
In the openssl directory, the key is a link to the cd filesystem.
When I need to create a signing key, I turn off the network
connection, put in the CD, create the key, eject the CD, then turn on
the network connection.
</p><p>
There are two people who have copies of the root key CD and know the
password.
</p>
<h2>Create the CA root key and self-signed certificate</h2>

<h4>Create the keypair:</h4>
<p>
<code><b>openssl genrsa -des3 -out root-ca.key 1024</b></code>

<p>You will be asked for a password which will be the CA password, and
then you'll be asked for that password again.  The output of this
command, the file <code><b>root-ca.key</b></code>, contains an RSA keypair which
is encryped using the password you supply.  So, for someone to use
this key to create new certificates (either host or client), they'll
need both this file and the password.</p>

<h4>Use the key to sign itself:</h4>
<p>
<code><b>openssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 -key root-ca.key -out root-ca.crt \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -config openssl.cnf</b></code>

<p>This reads, "create a new, self-signed X.509 certificate valid for
ten years, for the keypair in the file <code>root-ca.key</code>, and place
the output in the file <code>root-ca.crt</code>."

<p>You will be prompted to input identifying information for the
certificate.  It's important not to use single quotes in the responses
due to a quirk in the Globus implementation: for example don't use a
Common Name such as "<code><b>Alice's CA</b></code>".  If you have
customized the configuration file as suggested above, the defaults you
specified there will make this step easier.  The <code>openssl req</code>
command recognizes that the request is for a self signed certificate, and 
automatically applies suitable options, such as setting the "CA:TRUE" bit.</p>

<p>
Don't use an email address.  This avoids 
<a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/mail_archive/discuss/2004/01/msg00354.html">this 
interaction bug</a>
in signing policy files.

<h2>Preparing a directory structure for the root CA</h2>

In order to make use of two different CAs (<i>i.e.</i>, our root
CA in addition to our signing CA), OpenSSL needs either two
<code>openssl.cnf</code> files, or one with multiple CA sections.
We'll take the latter approach. 
<!-- Here's the <a
href="openssl.cnf.orig.html">original <code>openssl.cnf</code></a>
file (extracted from OpenSSL , our <a href="openssl.cnf.html">modified replacement</a>, and
a <a href="openssl.cnf.diff.html">diff</a>.  
-->  Here's our <a href="openssl.cnf.html">modified replacement</a>.
Basically what we do
is to copy the entire section marked CA_default to a section labeled
CA_root, and specify a different directory name for the directory
where CA files are stored.  Of course, we also need to change the
names of the files that contain the key and certificate appropriately.

<p>
The next step in this process is to set up a CA directory for
the <code>openssl ca</code> command.  Note that the directory contents
must reflect the settings in the <code>openssl.cnf</code> file just
created.  This can be done by executing <a
href="mk_new_ca_dir.html">this perl script</a>, which performs the
following steps:

<ol>
<li>Create a directory for the bookkeeping files to reside.
<li>Create a directory to store information about the certificates created.
<li>Create and initialize a file that stores a count of the number of certificates created.
<li>Create and initialize a file that stores a random seed.
</ol>

In other guides that describe how to sign certificates, these steps
are performed by the openssl script <code>sign.sh</code>.

<h2>Creating the signing certificates</h2>

Creating the signing certificates is nearly as easy.  The certificates
must be created with the "CA:TRUE" bit set, as noted above.  First, we
create the keypair for the signing key.  This is similar to the step
used to create the keypair for the root key, above.

<p>
<code><b>openssl genrsa -des3 -out signing-ca-1.key 1024</b></code>

<p>
Now, instead of creating the request and signing it with the private
key just created, as is done above, here we create a request in one
step, and then sign it using the root key in another.  First, we
create the request.
 (<a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/mail_archive/discuss/2004/01/msg00354.html">Don't
use</a> an email address here either.)

<p><code><b>openssl req -new -days 1095 -key signing-ca-1.key -out signing-ca-1.csr \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -config openssl.cnf</b></code>

<p>

Then, we sign the request, using the "<code>-name</code>" argument to
specify the section in the altered <code>openssl.cnf</code> file:

<p>
<code><b>openssl ca -config openssl.cnf -name CA_root -extensions v3_ca \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -out signing-ca-1.crt -infiles signing-ca-1.csr</b></code>

<h2>Preparing a directory structure for the signing CA</h2>

Now, we can create a directory structure for the signing key, using
the <a href="mk_new_ca_dir.html">same perl script</a> we used
to create the root CA directory structure.  This time, we give an
argument to the script to tell it the name of the directory,
corresponding to the directory name in the <code>openssl.cnf</code>
file.

<h2>Generating keys, signing requests, and certificates</h2>

<h3>Users</h3>

User certificates have the user name as the CN, and their email address.

OpenSSL allows you to create a key and a certificate signing request in one step:
<p>
<code><b>/usr/bin/openssl req -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout kosart.key \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -config openssl.cnf -out kosart.req</b></code>
<p>
Then sign it, remembering the signing key password:
<p>
<code><b>/usr/bin/openssl ca -config openssl.cnf \ <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -out kosart.crt \ <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -infiles kosart.req </b></code>

<h3>Hosts</h3>

Host certificates have the hostname as the CN (this is required for Globus), 
and the email address of the requester.<p>

<code><b>/usr/bin/openssl req -newkey rsa:1024 \ <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -keyout host_nmi-redhat62-build.key -nodes \ <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -config openssl.cnf -out host_nmi-redhat62-build.req </b></code>
<p>

<code><b>/usr/bin/openssl ca -config openssl.cnf \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -out host_nmi-redhat62-build.crt \<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -infiles host_nmi-redhat62-build.req</b></code>

<p>
There's a <a href="mk_certs.html">perl script</a> for generating certs from 
an <a href="real_input.txt">input</a> file.

<p>
Other handy OpenSSL commmand line tools:
<ul>
<li>To get a hash:<p><code><b>/usr/bin/openssl x509 -noout -hash -in host.crt</b></code>
<li>To get a subject:<p><code><b>/usr/bin/openssl x509 -noout -subject -in host.crt</b></code>
<li>To see the whole cert:<p><code><b>/usr/bin/openssl x509 -noout -text -in host.crt</b></code>
</ul>
